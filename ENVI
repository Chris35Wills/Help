Working with Landsatlook files
------------------------------

Downloaded via the GLOVIS viewer
Often be provided with a natural colour .jpg and a thrmal image .jpg as well as
a .wld file
The .wld file (ESRI) can be opened up in notepad - it's format is:
	
	pixel x size
	rotation about the y axis (normally 0)
	rotation about the x axis (normally 0)
	negative pixel Y size
	X coordinate of upper left pixel centre
	Y coordinate of upper left pixel centre
	
These values can be inserted into the header info in ENVI - the .wld file does
not contain the name of the projection (or zone) and this can be acquired from
the download page of the glovis site (if you click on your download on the
site, you get a preview image as well as metadata)
