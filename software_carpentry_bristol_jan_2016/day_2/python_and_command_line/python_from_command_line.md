##Aim 

Run programs from command line which can also take in user specified options

##Notes

Files have been saved according to additions
Really you should only have 1 file, each update being a separate commit!


More about command line:

wc -l file.csv 
	returns... 2 file.csv

wc -l < file.csv
	returns... 2

In the second example the method never read from the file so can;t return its name - it only got the contents
