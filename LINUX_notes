LINUX notes
===========

Access to bashrc:

nedit ~/.bashrc  - this is where the bash prompt is defined and it also holds path details

------------------------------------------------------

Use alias as defined in ~/.bashrc:

	In a terminal:
		> source ~/.bashrc
		> alias_name
		
------------------------------------------------------


Ctrl + v then Ctrl + i creates a tab character equivalent

Say you run a programme from a given console and you want to run something else
at the same time - you can do the following in order:

Ctrl + z		Pauses what is running
bg				Starts the process again but puts it in the background

...you can now use the command line again to start something else (which can
also be put in the background

You can then type:

jobs			To see what is running
fg 1			To bring job one back to the foreground

------------------------------------------------------

Ctrl + c					Closes the foreground task
csh name_of_script.csh		Runs a c shell script
nedit name_of_script.csh	Opens a specified file using a given programme (int
							this case, nedit)
top							shows you what is running (can be sorted by
							processes and memory usage using capitals P and M 
							respectively)			
history 10					echo the last 10 commands 
man gawk					access a manual (of gawk in this example) - to move
							through the manual use "n", quit using a "q" and 
							search for a word or character

ls							List files in a directory
ls -l						List files in a directory + directories

****************************
NB/ If you have a directory problem e.g. " /tmp/temp_coords: Permission denied. " just type:

> ls -h /tmp/temp_coords

... and this will give you details with regard to permissions of the file (maybe you can't 
access it because you don;t have the permission!) 
****************************

ls -d */ 			List all subdirectories in a directory
ls -lh						List files in a directory + directories + size
							(in a readable format)
ls -la						List files in a directory + hidden files
rm -rf <filename>			Delete specificied file
rm -Ri <folderpath>			Delete folder at specified path

ls rm -f $dataset/h* 		lists what is to be removed without removing it
ls rm -f  $dataset/m* 		lists what is to be removed without removing it

rm -f $dataset/h* 			remove all files in directory $database that begin with "h"
rm -f  $dataset/m* 			remove all files in directory $database that begin with "m"

cp -c blah1/ blah2/blah3			copy blah1 to within blah3 - use flags (e.g. -c) when dealing with folders
rsync -av /source/data/ target/		a better way to copy (everything) - have a look at the flags (-av is copy everything and verbose)
							
'...'						Quotes eactly what is written betwen the '..'
"..."						Quotes what is written betwen the ".." but if
							variables, these will still be used as such
							
"df -h "					States how much memory is in use (total system usage)
du -sk name					Size of file/folder

ps							Gives a list of processes and associated IDs
pgrep firefox				Gets the process ID of firefox (you could type any
							programme)
kill 22349					Kills process of number 22349

ps aux | grep firefox 		Gets the process ID of firefox (you could type any
							programme) that is being run on any login that you 
							may have (main or one of your tightVNC connections)
							(This is worth using if firefox tells you it is 
							aleady open and needs closing)
							
cut -c5-10 file.txt			cuts the 5th-10th characters from a text file and prints to stdout
cut -d"	" -f3  file.txt		provides the 3rd field as designated following a tab delimiter
		see: www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/06/cut-command-examples/

Logging into other machines from the Konsole

cd /geog/data				Enter this and then "ls" and you'll get a list

-----------------------------------------------------

mkdir foobar				Makes new direcory 'foobar'

man chmod					Manual for the chmod tool used for setting PERMISSIONS 
							(read/write/execute)

chmod -w 					Set current directory as writable
chmod -w test_folder		Set "test_folder" as writable

pwd							Gives you the current directory path	
which programmeName			Gives you the path directoy

-----------------------------------------------------

ls *d *.geo > list_geo								Create list of all things with suffix .geo
ls *d *.dem_par > list_dem_par						Create list of all things with suffix .dem_par
paste list_geo list_dem_par > list_multi_mosaic		Combine lists ino 1 list called list_multi_mosaic

man -k pdf					Find programmes that deal with pdf files 
xdg-open foo.pdf			Display pdf (better than evince)
evince file2open.pdf		Allows pdf file reading from terminal
display file2open.png		Uses ImageMagick to view a png file		

man -k grd					Finds any programme with "grd" in the title (useful for finding newe tools etc...) <- doesn't find everything though
							(only those with "manuals" -- i.e. can't use for finding gamma tools for example)"

------------------------------------------------------

Search for file (name):

find . -name \*png			Find files | in this directory (the ".") | with anything preceding "png" (wildcard * can be used but must be escaped with "\") 
find -name "query"			Find files in your current directroy of "name" - case sensitive
find -iname "query"			Find files in your current directroy of "name" - not case sensitive
