# Firefox won't work!! #

Perhaps you are getting an error like:

If firefox won't run, it may be running in a different session - the problem is that it can;t share a profile - you can kill it via:

```
pgrep firefox # gets PID
kill [firefox_PID]
## or ##
ps aux | pgrep firefox
kill [firefox_PID]
```

If that doesn't work, there may be a stuck lockfile - have a look at your profile directory:

```
~/.mozilla/firefox
```
This contains your profile and potentially any lock files that may exist preventing firefox from being run.
Youi can delete the lock files but do not delete your profile!!! If you do, then you'll have to build a new one (see below)

If none of the above works, try and build a new profile - this can be done on the command line by simply calling:

```
firefox -profilemanager
```
