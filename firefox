Firefox
=======

If firefox won;t run, it ay be running in a different session - you can kill it via:

pgrep firefox # gets PID
kill [firefox_PID]
-- or --
ps aux | pgrep firefox
kill [firefox_PID]

If that doesn't work, there may be a stuck lockfile - have a look at your profile directory:

~/.mozilla/firefox
	- contains your profile and potentially any lock files that may exist preventing firefox from being run
	- do not delete your profile!!!

If that doesn't work, try and build a new profile:

firefox -profilemanager
